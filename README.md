# cdk8s-kbld

**TLDR: A cdk8s construct for `kbld` configurations.**

Whenever I use cdk8s, I always need to build and push my container images to a registry. Currently, [`cdk8s-image`](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-image) enables building and pushing images *while generating manifests*. This causes side effects while generating configuration, which I've never been a massive fan of, but it is also limited by cdk8s' non-concurrent model, preventing building and/or pushing images in parallel (or using build tools other than Docker!).

There's a tool that does all this already (plus resolving and locking to digests, among other benefits): [`kbld`](https://github.com/carvel-dev/kbld)

`kbld` allows you to, with a single configuration file, find, build, push and resolve all the image references in your manifests. But that would require me to write a config file: ridiculous! So here's a cdk8s construct for `kbld` configurations that I can produce alongside all my other manifests.

```bash
# or bun, yarn, pnpm, etc.
npm i cdk8s-kbld
```

```ts
import { KbldConfig } from "cdk8s-kbld";

// ...

new Deployment(this, "example-deployment", {
    containers: [
        {
            image: "some-image-name",
            // ...
        },
		{
			image: "nginx:latest",
            // ...
		},
    ]
})

new KbldConfig(this, "kbld", {
    sources: [
        {
            image: "some-image-name",
            path: "/path/to/build/context",
        }
    ],
    destinations: [
        {
            image: "some-image-name",
            newImage: "ghcr.io/your-username/some-image-name"
        }
    ]
})
```

## Contributions and Roadmap
If you find a bug (fairly likely given the type definitions were translated from the `kbld` docs - carvel team, *please* use JSON schema, ty) please do post an issue or make a PR.

I have plans to add a resolver and/or a higher-level construct to avoid the need to even think much about the `kbld` config, but will be experimenting with this on my homelab manifests before beginning on that.
